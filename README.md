# OneStopSecurity

The plan for OneStopSecurity is to have a single program that can setup the security aspect of your server in 5 minutes rather than 45.

![](https://github.com/andrewkliskey/OneStopSecurity/workflows/shellcheck/badge.svg)

### What can OneStopSecurity do?

- Updates server (update, upgrade, dist-upgrade, autoremove, autoclean, updatedb)
- Change SSH Port 
- Install Fail2ban
- Whitelist your IP on Fail2Ban
- Install UFW Firewall (Deny Incoming/Allow Outgoing)
- Choose Ports to allow incoming connections from
- Install unattended-upgrades

### Take a think

- Please think before installing any software on your server:
  - Do you need it? üçû
  - Is it rated highly? ‚≠êÔ∏è
  - Could it be installing malware? üòà

Personally I would't trust a random script on the internet üåê so I understand if you don't. \
As this is only 150 lines of code I suggest that you take a look and ensure it is something you want to run on your server.

### How to run

Download the script, adjust permissions and run:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewkliskey/onestopsecurity/master/onestopsecurity.sh
chmod +x onestopsecurity.sh
./onestopsecurity.sh
```
Oneliner:
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewkliskey/onestopsecurity/master/onestopsecurity.sh | bash
```

### OneStopSecurity has been tested on:

| Operating System | Supported? |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Ubuntu 20.04     | ‚úÖ         |
| Ubuntu 18.04     | ‚úÖ         |
| Debian 10.3      | ‚úÖ         |
| Debian 9.12      | ‚úÖ         |

### To-do

  - [X] Add Continuous Integration with Github Actions
  - [ ] Disable SSH root access. This can be done manually by adding a `#` in front of `PermitRootLogin yes` within the SSH config file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
  - [ ] Add validation to user inputs
  - [ ] Adjust the Fail2ban config
  - [ ] Allow users to change the SSH port more than once (currently running it twice will open both ports up for SSH).
